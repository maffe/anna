<h1>Common Problems</h1>
           
<p>Describes common errors, anti-patterns and known bugs with the SimpleParse 
  2.0 engine.</p>
           
<h2>Repetition-as-Recursion</h2>
           
<p>Is <b>extremely inefficient</b>, it generates 4 new Python objects and 
  a number of new object pointers for every match (figure &gt; 100 bytes for
  each match), on top of the engine overhead in tracking the recursion, so
 if you have a 1-million character match that's “matching” for every character, 
  you'll have hundreds of megabytes of memory used.</p>
           
<p>In addition, if you are not using the non-recursive rewrite of mx.TextTools, 
  you can actually blow up the C stack with the recursive calls to tag().
 Symptoms of this are a memory access error when attempting to parse.</p>

 style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 50% 0%;">a := 'b', a? # bad!</span></font></font><br><font
 color="#0000ff"><span
 style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 50% 0%;">a := 'b'+ # good!</span></font></pre>
         
<h2> Null-match Children of Repeating Groups</h2>
           
<p>At present, there's no way for the engine to know whether a child has been
satisfied (matched) because they are optional (or all of their children are
optional), or because they actually matched.  The problem with the obvious 
  solution of just checking whether we've moved forward in the text is that 
  many classes of match object may match depending on external (non-text-based)
   conditions, so if we do the check, all of those mechanisms suddenly fail. 
   For now, make sure:</p>
           
<ul>
      	<li>                         
    <p><b>No child</b> of a 	<b>repeating FirstOfGroup</b> (x/y/z)+ or (x/y/z)* 
  can <b>match a 	Null-string</b></p>
      	</li>
       <li>                         
    <p><b>At least one child </b>	of a <b>repeating SequentialGroup </b>(x,y,z)+ 
  or (x,y,z)* <b>must not 	match</b> the Null-string</p>
      </li>
         
</ul>
           
<p>You can recognize this situation by the process going into an endless loop
with little or no memory being consumed.  To fix this one, I'd likely need
to add another return value type to the mxTextTools engine.</p>
           
<h2>No Backtracking</h2>
           
<p>The TextTools engine does not support backtracking as seen in RE engines 
  and many parsers, so productions like this can never match:</p>
           
<pre><font color="#ff0000">a := (b/c)*, c</font></pre>
         
<p> Because the 'c' productions will all have been consumed by the FirstOfGroup, 
  so the last 'c' can never match.  This is a fundamental limit of the current 
  back-end, so unless a new back-end is created, the problem will not go away.
   You will need to design your grammars accordingly.</p>
           
<h2>First-Of, not Longest-Of (Meaning of / )</h2>
           
<p>The production c := (a/b) produces a FirstOfGroup, that is, a group which 
  <b>matches the first child to match</b>.  Many parsers and regex engines 
 use an algorithm that matches all children and chooses the longest successful 
  match.  It would be possible to define a new TextTools tagging command to
  support  the longest-of semantics for Table/SubTable matches, but I haven't
  felt the need to do so.  If such a command is created, it will likely be
 spelled '|' rather than '/' in the SimpleParse grammar.<br>
</p>
<h2>Grouping Rules</h2>
<p>Although not particularly likely, users of SimpleParse 1.0 may have relied
on the (extremely non-intuitive) grouping mechanism for element tokens in
their grammars.  With that mechanism, the group:<br>
</p>
<pre>a,b,c/d,e<br></pre>
<p>was interpreted as:<br>
</p>
<pre>a,b,(c/(d,e))<br></pre>
<p>The new rule is simply that alternation binds closer than sequences, so
the same grammar becomes:<br>
</p>
<pre>a,b,(c/d),e<br></pre>
<p>which, though no more (or less) intuitive than:<br>
</p>
<pre>(a,b,c)/(d,e) ### it doesn't work this way!!!<br></pre>
<p>is certainly better than the original mechanism.<br>
</p>
 
<h2>mxTextTools Versions</h2>
 
<p>You will, if possible, want to use the non-recursive rewrite of the 2.1.0
mxTextTools engine (2.1.0nr).  At the time of writing, the mainline 2.1.0b3
has some errors (which I'm told are fixed for 2.1.0final), while the non-recursive 
rewrite passes all tests.  The bugs in the (recursive) engine(s) that are
known (and not likely to be fixed in the case of 2.1.0 final) are:<br>
 </p>
 
<ul>
   <li>Recursive data structure returns from reported subtable matches (not 
a problem for SimpleParse, we never report a subtable match. [2.0.3 only]</li>
   <li>Failure to truncate/report position for a failed table correctly (may 
confuse your code, as the results from failed matches may show up in your 
tag-lists [2.0.3 only]</li>
   <li>AppendToTag only supports list objects with [2.0.3 only]</li>
   <li>C Stack overflow with recursive calls [2.0.3 AND 2.1.0 (recursive)]<br>
   </li>
 
</ul>
