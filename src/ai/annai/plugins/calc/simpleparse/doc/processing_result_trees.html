<h1>Processing Result Trees</h1>
                         
<p>SimpleParse parsers generate tree structures describing the structure
of your parsed content. This document briefly describes the structures, a
simple mechanism for processing the structures, and ways to alter the structures
  as they are generated to accomplish specific goals.</p>
                         
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
                         
<ul>
              <li>     Python 2.x programming   </li>
              <li>     Familiarity with creating SimpleParse 2.0 Parsers
(see:        <a href="scanning_with_simpleparse.html">Scanning with SimpleParse</a>)
     </li>
                       
</ul>
                          
<h2>Standard Result Trees</h2>
                         
<p>SimpleParse uses the same result format as is used for the underlying
mx.TextTools engine.  The engine returns a three-item tuple from the parsing
of the top-level (root) production like so:</p>
                         
<pre>success, resultTrees, nextCharacter = myParser.parse( someText, processor=None)</pre>
                       
<p> Success is a Boolean value indicating whether the production (by default
      the root production) matched (was satisfied) at all.  If success is
true, nextCharacter is  an   integer value indicating the next character
to be parsed in the text  (i.e.   someText[ startCharacter:nextCharacter
] was parsed).<br>
   </p>
     
<p><i>[New in 2.0.0b2]</i> Note: If success is false, then nextCharacter is
set to the (very ill-defined) "error position", which is the position reached
by the last TextTools command in the top-level production before the entire
table failed. This is a lower-level value than is usefully predictable within
SimpleParse (for instance, negative results which cause a failure will actually
report the position after the positive version of the element token succeeds).
 You might, I suppose, use it as a hint to your users of where the error
occured, but using error-on-fail SyntaxErrors is <b>by far</b> the prefered
method.  Basically, if success is false, consider nextCharacter to contain
garbage data.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>When the processor argument to parse is false (or a non-callable object),
  the system does not attempt     to use the default processing mechanism,
 and returns the result trees directly.     The standard format for result-tree
  nodes is as follows:</p>
                         
<pre>(production_name, start, stop, children_trees)</pre>
                       
<p> Where start and stop represent indexes in the source text such that sourcetext
      [ start: stop] is the text which matched this production. The <b>list
  of children   </b> is the list of a list of the result-trees for the child
  productions within    the production, or <b>None</b> (Note: that last is
 important, you can't automatically do a "for" over the children_trees).<br>
    </p>
       
<p>Expanded productions, as well as unreported productions (and the children
      of unreported productions), will not appear in the result trees, neither
     will the root production. See <a href="simpleparse_grammars.html">Understanding
  SimpleParse Grammars</a> for details. However, LookAhead productions where
 the non-lookahead value would normally return results, will return their
results in the position where the LookAhead is included in the grammar.</p>
       
<p>If the processor argument to parse is true and callable, the processor
  object will be called with (success, resultTrees, nextCharacter) on completion
  of parsing.  The processor can then take whatever processing steps desired,
  the return value from calling the processor with the results is returned
 directly to the caller of parse.<br>
     </p>
                                           
<h2>DispatchProcessor</h2>
                         
<p>SimpleParse 2.0 provides a simple mechanism for processing result trees,
  a recursive series of calls to attributes of  a  “Processor” object with
 functions to automate the call-by-name dispatching.  This processor implementation
 is available for examination in the simpleparse.dispatchprocessor module.
  The main functions are:</p>
                         
<pre>def dispatch( source, tag, buffer ):<br>	"""Dispatch on source for tag with buffer<br><br>	Find the attribute or key "tag-object" (tag[0]) of source,<br>	then call it with (tag, buffer)<br>	"""<br>def dispatchList( source, taglist, buffer ):<br>	"""Dispatch on source for each tag in taglist with buffer"""<br><br>def multiMap( taglist, source=None, buffer=None ):<br>	"""Convert a taglist to a mapping from tag-object:[list-of-tags]<br>	<br>	For instance, if you have items of 3 different types, in any order,<br>	you can retrieve them all sorted by type with multimap( childlist)<br>	then access them by tagobject key.<br><br>	If source and buffer are specified, call dispatch on all items.<br>	"""<br><br>def singleMap( taglist, source=None, buffer=None ):<br>	"""Convert a taglist to a mapping from tag-object:tag, <br>	overwritting early with late tags.  If source and buffer<br>	are specified, call dispatch on all items."""<br><br>def getString( (tag, left, right, sublist), buffer):<br>	"""Return the string value of the tag passed"""<br><br>def lines( start=None, end=None, buffer=None ):<br>	"""Return number of lines in buffer[start:end]"""<br></pre>
                       
<p>With a class <b>DispatchProcessor</b>, which provides a __call__ implementation
  to trigger dispatching for both "called as root processor" and "called
to   process an individual result element" cases.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>You define a DispatchProcessor sub-class with methods named for each production
  that will be processed by the processor, with signatures of:<br>
    </p>
       
<pre>from simpleparse.dispatchprocessor import *<br>class MyProcessorClass( DispatchProcessor ):<br>	def production_name( self, (tag,start,stop,subtags), buffer ):<br>		"""Process the given production and it's children"""<br></pre>
       
<p>Within those production-handling methods, you can call the dispatch functions
  to process the sub-tags of the current production (keep in mind that the
 sub-tags "list" may be a None object).  You can see examples of this processing
 methodology in simpleparse.simpleparsegrammar, simpleparse.common.iso_date
 and simpleparse.common.strings (among others).<br>
    </p>
       
<p>For real-world Parsers, where you normally use the same processing class
  for all runs of the parser, you can define a default Processor class like
  so:<br>
    </p>
       
<p></p>
       
<pre>class MyParser( Parser ):<br>	def buildProcessor( self ):<br>		return MyProcessorClass()</pre>
                       
<p>so that if no processor is explicitly specified in the parse call, your
  "MyProcessorClass" instance will be used for processing the results.<br>
    </p>
                                          
<h2><a name="nonstandardresulttrees"></a>Non-standard Result Trees (AppendMatch,
AppendToTagobj, AppendTagobj,       CallTag)</h2>
                         
<p>SimpleParse 2.0 introduced features which expose certain of the mx.TextTool
      library's features for producing non-standard result trees.  Although
  not    generally recommended for use in “normal” parsers, these features
 are useful    for certain types of text processing, and their exposure was
 requested.  Each  flag has a different effect on the result tree, the particular
 effects  are  discussed below.</p>
                         
<p>The exposure is through the Processor (or more precisely, a super-class
      of Processor called “MethodSource”) object. To specify the use of one
  of the flags, you set an attribute    in your MethodSource object (your
Processor  object) with the    name _m_productionname (for the “method” to
use, which  is either an actual    callable object for use with CallTag,
or one of the  other mx.TextTools  flag   constants above).  In the case
of  AppendTagobj  , you will likely want to   specify a particular tagobj
object to be appended,  you do that by setting   an attribute named _o_productionname
in your MethodSource.   For AppendToTagobj,   you <b>must</b><span
 style=""> specify an _o_productionname  object with an “append” method.<br>
    </span></p>
       
<p><span style="">Note: you can use MethodSource as your direct ancestor
if you want to define a non-standard result tree, but don't want to do any
processing of the results (this is the reason for having seperate classes).
 MethodSource does not define a __call__ method.<br>
    </span></p>
                         
<h3>CallTag</h3>
                         
<pre>_m_productionname = callableObject<code>(</code><br><code>    taglist,</code><br><code>    text,</code><br><code>    left,</code><br><code>    right,</code><br><code>    subtags</code><br><code>)</code></pre>
                       
<p> The given object/method is called on a successful match with the values
      shown.  The text argument is the entire text buffer being parsed, the
  rest    of the values are what you're accustomed to seeing in result tuples.</p>
                         
<p>Notes:</p>
                         
<ul>
             	<li>               Nothing is (necessarily) added to the results 
list when 	CallTag    is specified!  If you want something added, call taglist.append( 
item ).   	    	</li>
              <li>              Raising an error in the CallTag method will 
 	halt    parsing.    	</li>
              <li>                    The  callableObject  is accessed from 
 the   	MethodSource object using   standard getattr, so if you are using 
a 	function,   it will need to define   a “self” parameter for 	the first 
position.       </li>
                       
</ul>
                         
<h3>AppendToTagobj</h3>
                         
<pre>_m_productionname = AppendToTagobj<br>_o_productionname = objectWithAppendMethod</pre>
                       
<p> On a successful match, the system will call _o_productionname.append((None,l,r,subtags))
      method.  For some processing tasks, it's conceivable you might want
to   use   this method to pull out all instances of a production from a larger
   (already-written)   grammar where going through the whole results tree
to   find the deeply nested   productions is considered too involved.</p>
                         
<p>Notes:</p>
                         
<ul>
             	<li>          Nothing is added to the results list when 	AppendToTagobj
     is specified!    	</li>
              <li>      Raising an error in the AppendToTagobj method 	will 
 halt   parsing.    </li>
                       
</ul>
                         
<h3>AppendMatch</h3>
                         
<pre>_m_productionname = AppendMatch</pre>
                       
<p> On a successful match, the system will append the matched text to the 
      result tree, rather than a tuple of results.  In situations where you 
  just   want to extract the text, this can be useful.  The downside is that 
  your  results tree has a non-standard format that you need to explicitly 
 watch out for while processing the results.</p>
                         
<h3>AppendTagobj</h3>
                         
<pre>_m_productionname = AppendTagobj<br>_o_productionname = any object<br># object is optional, if omitted, the production name string is used</pre>
                       
<p> On a successful match, the system will append the tagobject to the result
      tree, rather than a tuple of results.  In situations where you just
want     notification that the production has matched (and it doesn't matter
what    it matched), this can be useful.  The downside, again, is that your
results    tree has a non-standard format that you need to explicitly watch
out for   while processing the results.</p>
